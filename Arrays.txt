For for loop use array.length to iterate

Iterate over an Array through for each loop: for(num:array)

OR you can simply print elemnts in an array using toString() mwthod: System.out.print(Arrays.toString(array));

Arrays are mutable in java. Mutable means you can change the object.

Multi-Dimensional Arrays:- Declaring the number of rows is mandatory, but not the number of columns.

ArrayList: ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
Functions of it: list.add, remove, get, contains etc.
ArrayList is fixed internally, and when some space is been filled then it creates a new Arraylist double or more the size of old list and copies the elements of old list into new one.

Multi-Dimensional ArrayList: ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
